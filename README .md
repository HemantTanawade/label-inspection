## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop a real-time Label Inspection System that identifies defective labels. The system is built with OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for deep learning. It leverages a custom-trained CNN model to classify labels as either defective or non-defective based on images captured in real-time from cameras or input through other sources.
## Features

- Real-time defect detection: Utilizes live image feeds for immediate detection of label defects.
- Deep learning model: Trained on labeled image data using a CNN, ensuring high accuracy in defect identification.
- Early stopping: Optimizes training time and prevents overfitting by utilizing early stopping mechanisms during model training.
- Performance metrics: Evaluates model accuracy using confusion matrices and classification reports.


## Technologies
